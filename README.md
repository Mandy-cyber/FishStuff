# **THE PROBLEM**

<br><br>

# **THE DATA**
## ‚òÇÔ∏è Basic Overview
The dataset takes the shape **(159, 11)** , meaning there are 159 rows (excluding the heading row) and 11 columns.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib as plt
import numpy as np

df_fish = pd.read_csv('fish.csv') 
print(df_fish.shape)
```
With only 159 rows of data this is a considerably small dataset and hence any predictions derived from it would have low accuracy levels. This point will be furthered in the [Statistics & Observations](https://github.com/Mandy-cyber/FishStuff/blob/main/README.md#-statistics--observations) section.

## üî¢ Statistics & Observations
### *Numerical Columns*
For each numerical column, the following statistical data was found using `df_fish.describe()` :
<ul>
  <li><b>COUNT</b> - number of (non-NULL) values in column</li>
  <li><b>MEAN</b> - average</li>
  <li><b>STD</b> - standard deviation</li>
  <li><b>MIN</b> - smallest value</li>
  <li><b>25%</b> - lower percentile</li>
  <li><b>50%</b> - median</li>
  <li><b>75%</b> - upper percentile</li>
  <li><b>MAX</b> - largest value</li>
</ul>

The 'count' value remains constant throughout as there are no NULL values in any of the columns. It is also important to note that the standard deviation value for each column is large in relation to their mean values. This represents the broad spread of data within each column (the data values aren't very close to the mean), and this is further backed by the large interquartile ranges. In this scenario, the large standard deviation is not alarming as the dataset is simply showing recorded general observations across many different features. It would be [interesting](https://github.com/Mandy-cyber/FishStuff/blob/main/README.md#-key-observations), however, to break the dataset down further and look at the standard deviation for e.g the 'Catch Percentage', parish by parish. This could be used by Farmers to determine in which parish(es) they would be most likely to catch fish.

What the above information also shows is an outlier. The 'min' value for the 'Avg Weight/g' was zero grams, which is, of course, not a valid weight as *weight > zero*. In a scenario where the mean value is necessary, the trimmed mean (TrMean) could be calculated.

### *Categorical Columns*
For each categorical column, the following statistical data was found using `df_fish.describe(include=[object])` :
<ul>
  <li><b>COUNT</b> - same as in numerical (constant value in this dataset)</li>
  <li><b>UNIQUE</b> - number of non-repeated (unique) values</li>
  <li><b>TOP</b> - the most common value (mode)</li>
  <li><b>FREQ</b> - the frequency of the mode</li>
</ul>
